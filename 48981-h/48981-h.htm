<h2 id="PREFACE_AND_INSTRUCTIONS">PREFACE AND INSTRUCTIONS.</h2>


<p>Owing to the fact that some of the types of animals available for
the study of Zoology in South Africa differ from those described
in text books for students in other countries, it has been
found necessary to draw up special directions and diagrams for
laboratory use in this country. These are now put in the more
convenient form of a text book, which, though intended primarily
for the use of the students of the University of Cape Town, may,
it is hoped, prove useful to others engaged in the teaching and
study of Zoology in South Africa.</p>

<p>The general plan of the course intended to be followed is first
an introductory study of a type of vertebrate. The Platana or
Clawed Toad, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Xenopus lævis</i>, is the most convenient type for this in
South Africa and in some respects is more instructive than the Frog.</p>

<p>Xenopus is therefore chiefly dealt with, but Rana can also be
used, the differences in this type being indicated in italics. It is
recommended that both types be studied where possible.</p>

<p>Only these two types are dealt with here, but may be followed
by descriptions of other South African types, such as the South
African Crawfish, Dogfish, Earthworm, etc.</p>

<p>It is intended that the student should make drawings of his dissections
on the blank page. He should not copy the diagrams, but
draw what he actually sees, and be prepared to demonstrate the
parts to the teacher.</p>

<p>The instruments required are a large and a small pair of
scissors, a large and a small scalpel, moderately fine forceps, a
seeker, and pins.</p>

<p>We are indebted to Mr. W. von Bonde, M.A., for the drawing
of Figs. 3-5, 7-10.</p>

<p>1. Make a drawing of the animal viewed from above, showing:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>a</i>) The nostrils.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>b</i>) The eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>c</i>) The nictitating membrane and a short tentacle beneath the
eye. [<em>The tentacle is absent in the Frog.</em>]</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>d</i>) The tympanic membrane, which is not shown in the Platana,
but is well marked in the Frog.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>e</i>) The opening of the cloaca.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>f</i>) The limbs and their divisions.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>g</i>) The skin with tube-like lines round the body. [<em>In the Frog
these lines are not present.</em>]</p>

<p>2. Make an enlarged drawing, about twice the natural size, showing:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>a</i>) The fore-limb with the digits.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>b</i>) The hind-limb with the digits. The inner three digits have
claws. [<em>The claws are absent in the Frog.</em>]</p>

<p>Name the parts of these limbs, and number the digits from within outwards,
noting that the first is absent in the fore-limb.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a><br /><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p class="topic">Mouth Cavity.</p>

<p>Open the mouth cavity widely, and make a sketch showing:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>a</i>) The teeth on the upper jaw.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>b</i>) There are no teeth on the vomer. [<em>In the Frog each vomer is
supplied with teeth.</em>]</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>c</i>) The internal openings of the nostrils.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>d</i>) The single opening of the Eustachian tubes. [<em>In the Frog there
is an opening on each side.</em>]</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>e</i>) There is no tongue. [<em>A tongue is present in the Frog.</em>]</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>f</i>) The glottis.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>g</i>) The gullet.</p>

<p>Owing to the complexity of the Eustachian tubes and the bony form
of the ear cavity, it is not possible to pass a seeker from the Eustachian
aperture through the tympanic membrane. [<em>In the Frog the Eustachian tubes
are short and straight and permit of this being done.</em>]</p>

<p>1. Pin the Platana on its back in water, and cut through the skin with
scissors along the middle line, throughout the whole length of the body.
Pin back the skin on each side, and make a drawing showing:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>a</i>) The muscles:</p>

<p class="indent2">(i) Two pectoralis muscles passing from the base of the arm, the
one to the middle line of the body, and the other over the
abdominal region to the posterior part of the body. Cut
through this latter muscle at its anterior end, and fold it backwards
to expose the underlying brachial vein.</p>

<p class="indent2">(ii) The rectus-abdominis muscles passing along the mid-ventral
line of the body, with the white line (linea alba) in the centre.</p>

<p class="indent2">(iii) The deltoid muscle to the arm.</p>

<p class="indent2">(iv) The mylo-hyoid muscle, on the underside of the mouth region.</p>

<p class="indent2">(v) The obliquus-externus muscle, lying under the second pectoralis
muscle noted above.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a><br /><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">(<i>b</i>) The cutaneous and the muscular veins, lying under the pectoralis
muscle, and arising independently from the subclavian vein. They
supply the skin and muscles in the region of the arm. There is a
second cutaneous vein arising from the abdominal vein and extending
on to the skin of the abdomen. Two other small cutaneous
veins are seen on the skin of the leg, and another on the skin under
the mouth.</p>

<p class="indent2">[<em>In the Frog a single musculo-cutaneous vein is seen lying under
the pectoralis muscle and extends on to the skin.</em>]</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>c</i>) The abdominal vein, partly visible through the wall of the body, in
the centre of the rectus-abdominis muscle.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>d</i>) The brachial vein going to the arm, near which may often be seen
the white brachial nerve. Endeavour to trace the point of origin
of the brachial, muscular, and cutaneous veins (<em>or the brachial and
musculo-cutaneous veins in the Frog</em>) as shown in the figures.</p>

<p>2. Make an incision in the body wall, slightly to the right side of the
abdominal vein, which may now be seen clearly on the inner side of the
body wall. Carefully detach this vein from the abdominal wall.</p>

<p class="topic"><b>Skeletal System</b> (<em>Part</em>).</p>

<p>1. Remove the pectoralis muscles covering the body between the arms
to show the bones of the central part of the shoulder girdle and sternum,
viz.:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>a</i>) The thick coracoids.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>b</i>) The more slender clavicles anterior to them, both extending from
the base of the arm on each side towards the centre of the body.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>c</i>) The sternum, consisting of a median row of cartilages which are
believed to be derived from the shoulder girdle. It does not, therefore,
correspond to, or is not homologous with, the sternum of the
Pigeon or the Rabbit, which is derived from the ribs. The sternum
consists of the following parts:</p>

<p class="indent2">(i) The two epicoracoids consisting of cartilage.</p>

<p class="indent2">(ii) The metasternum which is broad and consists of cartilage only.</p>

<p class="indent2">A. Venous System.</p>

<p>1. Note:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>a</i>) The heart lying in the thin pericardium, the two auricles, the single
ventricle, the truncus arteriosus which divides into two branches.</p>

<p class="indent">Remove the pericardium from the heart, and tilt the apex of
the heart forwards, noting the sinus venosus into which the right
and the left superior venæ cavæ (or precavals) and the single inferior
vena cava (or postcaval) open.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>b</i>) The veins passing from each side of the sinus venosus. Each superior
vena cava is joined by the following branches:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent2">(i) The external jugular vein from the region of the tongue and
the mandible.</p>

<p class="indent2">(ii) The internal jugular vein from the head and a thick subscapular
vein from the shoulder. These veins join the superior vena
cava independently of each other so that there is no innominate
vein as in the Frog.</p>

<p class="indent2">(iii) The subclavian vein, made up of a brachial vein from the arm,
a cutaneous vein from the skin, and a muscular vein from the
abdominal muscles. The cutaneous and the muscular veins
are separate veins so that there is no single musculo-cutaneous
vein.</p>

<p class="indent">[<em>In the Frog the superior vena cava is joined by the following branches</em>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent2">(<i>i</i>) <em>The external jugular vein, formed by the union of a lingual vein
from the tongue and a mandibular vein from the margin of the
lower jaw.</em></p>

<p class="indent2">(<i>ii</i>) <em>The internal jugular vein from the head and the subscapular vein
from the back of the arm and shoulder, both joining the superior
vena cava by a common vein, the innominate.</em></p>

<p class="indent2">(<i>iii</i>) <em>The subclavian vein, formed by the brachial vein from the fore-limb
and a musculo-cutaneous vein from the muscles of the body
and from the skin.</em>]</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>c</i>) The hypoglossal and the glossopharyngeal nerves, both running
alongside of the lingual artery.</p>

<p class="indent">Make an enlarged drawing showing the above parts (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>).</p>

<p>2. Note the inferior vena cava, receiving the renal veins from the kidneys,
the hepatic veins from the liver, and opening into the sinus venosus.</p>

<p>3. Trace back the abdominal vein, and note that it is formed by the
union of the two pelvic veins, which pass along the bases of the legs. The
pelvic veins occur deep down in the body under the posterior part of the
pelvic girdle, which should be cut through in order to see them. At the
union of the pelvic veins to form the abdominal vein a small rectal vein,
passing along the ventral surface of the rectum, joins the abdominal vein.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a><br /><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>In order to make out the femoral and the sciatic veins, turn the Platana
over and remove the skin from the back of the leg. The femoral vein may
then be seen lying on the surface of the leg, between two of the muscles.
By carefully separating these muscles the whole of the femoral vein may
be exposed. Deeper down in the muscles of the leg lies the sciatic vein,
and, between the sciatic and the femoral veins, the internal iliac artery may
be seen running alongside of the sciatic nerve.</p>

<p>Trace the femoral and the sciatic veins forward, and note that they join
together at the point where they meet the pelvic veins and then run forward
to the kidney as the renal portal vein on each side.</p>

<p>Turn the Platana over again on to its back and note the renal portal
vein from the ventral side. Joining the renal portal vein is a large vein
formed of two branches. The one branch arises in the abdominal wall,
while the other passes along the base of the leg and joins the abdominal
vein. On each side three dorso-lumbar veins join the renal portal vein.</p>

<p>[<em>In the Frog the abdominal vein is also formed by the union of the two
pelvic veins. The pelvic veins, however, lie more superficially than in the
Platana. The femoral vein which passes along the front of the thigh divides
into two branches, the one branch forming the pelvic vein, the other, joined by
the sciatic vein from the muscles and skin of the back of the thigh, forming the
renal portal vein extending along the outer side of the kidney. The dorso-lumbar
vein from the dorsal wall of the body joins the renal portal vein.</em>]</p>

<p>B. The Peripheral Nervous System.</p>

<p class="indent">1. The Spinal Nerves.</p>

<p>Remove the abdominal viscera carefully so as to expose the spinal nerves
which are seen as white cords on each side of the vertebral column as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>a</i>) The first or hypoglossal nerve arising between the 1st and 2nd
vertebræ. It runs forwards on the under surface of the head beneath
the mylo-hyoid muscle and supplies the tongue. It was noted in
the third day's work.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>b</i>) The second and third nerves unite immediately after escaping from
the spinal cord to form the brachial plexus, which supplies the
muscles of the shoulder, and then extends along the arm.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>c</i>) The fourth, fifth, and sixth nerves are small and supply the muscles
and the skin of the body wall.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>d</i>) The seventh, eighth, and ninth nerves run obliquely backwards, the
eighth and ninth uniting to form the sciatic plexus, which gives
rise to the large sciatic nerve which extends along the thigh, and
down the leg. The sciatic plexus also receives a branch from the
seventh nerve.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>e</i>) The tenth or coccygeal nerve, which escapes through a small aperture
in the side of the urostyle, and is distributed to the walls of the
cloaca and urinary bladder. It is connected by a branch with the
sciatic nerve. This nerve is frequently small or absent in the
Platana.</p>

<p>[<em>In the Frog, the seventh, eighth, and ninth nerves unite to form the sciatic
plexus which gives rise to the large sciatic nerve extending along the thigh, and
dividing above the knee into the tibial and peroneal nerves to the leg and the foot.

<p class="indent">2. The Sympathetic Nervous System.</p>

<p>This system consists of a cord on each side closely following the course
of the systemic arches and the dorsal aorta. It has on it six ganglionic
swellings, and there are connections between the ganglia and all the spinal
nerves. Anteriorly each of the cords is joined to the vagus nerve; it ends
posteriorly as a broad swelling on the ninth spinal nerve.</p>

<p>[<em>In the Frog the system consists of a chain of ganglia on each side of the
body closely following the course of the systemic arches and the dorsal aorta.
The cords have connections with the spinal nerves. Anteriorly each cord ends

<p class="indent">(<i>a</i>) The olfactory nerve, arising from the anterior end of the olfactory
lobes, supplying the olfactory capsule.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>b</i>) The optic nerve, arising from the ventral surface of the brain below
the optic lobes, supplying the retina of the eye.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>c</i>) The trigeminal nerve, arising just behind the optic nerve, giving
rise to the following branches:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent2">(<i>i</i>) The ophthalmic nerve, which passes over the muscles of the eye
and supplies the skin in the region of the olfactory capsule.</p>

<p class="indent2">(<i>ii</i>) The maxillary nerve, which runs forward under the eyeball,
and supplies the skin covering the upper jaw.</p>

<p class="indent2">(<i>iii</i>) The mandibular nerve, which is at first continuous with the
maxillary, and then bends round the inner surface of the upper
jaw to extend along the outer surface of the mandible.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>d</i>) The glossopharyngeal and the vagus (or pneumogastric) nerves,
leaving the skull together, immediately behind the auditory capsule.
The glossopharyngeal passes along in front of the hypoglossal nerve
and proceeds along the base of the tongue. The vagus, after giving
off branches to the dorsal muscles, reaches the walls of the pharynx
and run obliquely backwards to supply the pharynx, heart, lungs
and stomach.</p>
